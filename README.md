Prototype implementation of an SVG-based symbol with independently scalable width and height.  Useful only as a sample of a custom symbol.

## Sample application use

An example application is provided [here](https://github.com/pacruz/scalable-marker-symbol-viewer).  This shows one way to import this module into a webpack project.

To add manually, add the module using the following:

```bash
npm i --save git+ssh://git@github.com/pacruz/scalable-marker-symbol.git
```

## Known issues

This hasn't been tested very thoroughly, so there are probably bugs.
